# Uart-Communication-Protocol
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol widely used in electronics. It facilitates the asynchronous transmission of data between devices. 
UART operates on two wires, one for transmitting (TX) and one for receiving (RX). It is known for its simplicity and versatility, making it a common choice for communication
between microcontrollers, sensors, and various peripherals. The absence of a shared clock signal distinguishes UART from synchronous communication protocols.


TO RUN IT IN VERILOG, Copy and paste codes in verilog(.v) files and save them with names of your choice in the same directory and run it on terminal with the usual irun command(make sure you have mentor graphics or vivado or any other verilog tool).
I have attached my outputs in the pdf. Do refer to it to know more!
